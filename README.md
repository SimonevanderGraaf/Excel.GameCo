# Excel.GameCo
Until 2016 GameCo has been consistent in dividing their marketing budget over the main three regions: North America, Europe and Japan. The executive board expects that the sales of these regions have not changed over time and therefore thinks there will be no changes in the marketing budget plan for 2017.
As this is only based on an assumption, I will analyze the sales to learn if the market has changed and whether the marketing budget plan needs important changes in order to stay competitive.
# Key Questions
- Are certain types of games more popular than others?
- What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?
- Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?
- How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?
# Data
The following dataset has been used for this analysis:
- video games sales dataset
# Tools
For this project I used excel for both the analyses and visualisations. I used powerpoint to create the presentation.
# Source
The data was drawn from the website [VGChartz](https://www.vgchartz.com).
